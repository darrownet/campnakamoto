          <li><i>🔌</i><strong>Unfinished, Yet Electrifying</strong>: Our cabins might be rustic, but they&apos;ve got electricity – perfect for charging your devices or lighting up those late-night power law vs. stock-to-flow discussions. Think of it as &apos;unfinished luxury&apos;.</li>
          <li><i>💧</i><strong>Waterfront Living</strong>: Just steps from your cabin, you&apos;ll find yourself at the water&apos;s edge. Here, the only thing more refreshing than a dip in the lake is the genuine summer camp vibe.</li>
          <li><i>🚻</i><strong>Communal Commodes</strong>: Embrace the community spirit with our common lavatories. Here, you&apos;ll share more than just tips on Bitcoin; you&apos;ll share the true camp experience.</li>
